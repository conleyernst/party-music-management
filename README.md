## Problem Statement

Have you ever been at a party or event where everyone is shouting over each other? Have you ever had to fight for the aux cord? Have you ever completely lost the attention of a group because they couldn’t stand your music choice?

We’ve all been there.

Introducing our application: a new organized way to queue an awesome party playlist. Instead just hoping a collaborative playlist will go over well the night of, our application offers a unique way to have real time collaboration. 

Our system is hosted by the DJ and can be interacted with party guests. Guests can easily submit requests, see the queue, or veto songs even before they’re played. This way, everyone can have their favorite track played without having to find or reach out to the DJ.
